Dude, I just finished watching Bring Her Back and my head's still spinning. Like, what even was that ending!? I mean, seriously, did they think we’d just be cool with how it wrapped up? Maybe I’m missing something, but it’s got me feeling like I need to download the movie and frame-by-frame dissect it like it's a crime scene.

> Oh man, the characters, though... it’s like they all decided coherence is overrated. I love how they start with that whole mysterious vibe and then just—bam—everyone loses their minds. It's kinda like they were all going through some chaotic emo phase. Still, kinda love that unpredictable energy, you know what I mean?

Anyway, the whole vibe had me laughing at stuff that wasn't even funny. Or maybe it was, in some ironic way. Like when that dude kept repeating the same sketchy line every five minutes. Made me wanna shout at the screen, “Bro, get a new script!” But props to the actors for keeping at it, I guess?

So, somewhere halfway through, I'm thinking we should watch the movie together next time. Would be way more fun to roast it as a team effort LOL. The special effects were actually not half-bad, though. Had me questioning if aliens were low-key running Hollywood these days.

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { Console.WriteLine(Why am I even doing this?); }

Alright, I'm wiped out now but still kinda buzzed from it all. Leave it to a movie to totally wreck your brain and feel like you’ve just run a mental marathon, ya know? Talk later, dude!
